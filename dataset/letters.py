dear p-chan,

sorry for this huge text out of the blue. i just got a bit worried last night because you replied late
i mean thats fine. you dont have to apologize
like its fine if you're a little late sometimes
but i was a little scared...

ever since i was little
my parents never paid me any attention
like, ever

every time i tried to talk to them theyd ignore me
theyd just be like yeah, yeah and go back to whatever they were doing
and you do that too, you know. so please stop
it really fucks with me
i know its not exactly abuse but yeah

i know we're both busy and all but
having to sleep alone at night makes me scared
its so dark at night...

it happened yesterday too
i felt so lonely and i couldnt stop crying so i tried to call you
but i was scared of bothering you so late at night
sorry for the wordvomit
i know this is all my fault

but i wanted to let you know how i feel
i dont want to be alone at night anymore...

please stay with me forever, p-chan

dear p-chan,

you promised me youd stay by my side forever but you abandoned me to go to the conbini, didnt you? and at night, even...

do you know how lonely you made me feel? i cant even joke about this with the stupid pleading emoji

my health used to be really bad, you know. it was so, so, so bad. ive gotten a bit better now, but im still too scared to be left alone!

my mom used to always stay right by my side... but shes gone now

i get really scared even just at the thought of you being gone, and then when i woke up yesterday, you just disappeared...

so can you not just leave without asking me? and be nice to me even when i go a bit crazy from the magicals or cut... i know i shouldnt be doing either of those things but i cant help it

oh but if you want to go out during the day that should be fine, like if you want to buy me some pudding to cheer me up... youd want to do that kind of stuff for me, right? but you still have to ask me first!

id totally let you go out depending on the time of day and your reasoning! so stay with me as always, tomorrow and the day after, all day until the sun rises...

dear p-chan, who is always so kind to me

remember when we went to the supermarket yesterday
and there was that kid who kept crying coz his friends kept ignoring him?
he reminded me of something from when i was a kid
sorry for the incoming wordvomit but i want you to know me better
youre the only one i can talk about this with

when i was in elementary school
i was bullied. like, a lot.
the girl who was like the queen bee of my class came after me
and said "you think youre the cutest girl in world, dont you?"

dear p-chan,

when i start earning more lets move to a nicer place
nicer not just on camera
but also everywhere else in the house too
and we can make the entire house nice and cute

and we can get a bigger bed for the two of us
and we can sleep together on it every night
until a new day comes and the night falls again

thinking about all this reminds me of when i was a kid

we were really poor
like, really really poor
we had no money at all and my mom was about to force me to be a prostitute

i ran away from home
started hopping around to whoever in my friend group would take me in

so im really happy that i have a home with you now, p-chan

you wont abandon me, right?
i dont want to be broke and alone again

so please
please stay with me
i love you

to my favorite person, p-chan

i wanted to tell you this in person but
i got too embarrassed so im writing this instead

i really, really love you a lot, p-chan
more than anything or anyone else in the world
i love you so much

so promise me that we'll get married someday?

ive got a lot of emotional baggage
but dont tell anyone ok?
well not that anyones interested anyway haha

my parents used to fight a lot
nearly every day
my mom even tried to throw a knife at my dad once...

i was so scared
they ended up getting divorced
but the fighting didnt stop
they just kept fighting over who would get custody of me

i was so scared of being at home every day
so i promised myself that when i grew up
i would get married to someone that would make me happy, unlike my parents
you get where im coming from, right?

i swear ill become the worlds best streamer
i swear ill become bigger and brighter just for you. so please?

i love you
